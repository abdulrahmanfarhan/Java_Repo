| - numberOfYears: int           |
| - loanAmount: double           |

| + getTotalPayment(): double    |
| + getLoanDate(): Date          |

```

## Usage
### Basic Calculation
```java
Loan mortgage = new Loan(4.5, 30, 500000);
System.out.printf("Monthly Payment: $%.2f", mortgage.getMonthlyPayment());
```

### Full Test Program
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate (e.g., 5.25): ");
        double rate = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.print("Enter loan term (years): ");
        int years = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter loan amount: ");
        double amount = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        Loan loan = new Loan(rate, years, amount);
        
        System.out.printf("\nLoan Summary:\nCreated: %s\nMonthly: $%.2f\nTotal: $%.2f",
            loan.getLoanDate(),
            loan.getMonthlyPayment(),
            loan.getTotalPayment()
        );
    }
}
```

## Mathematical Model
### Monthly Payment Formula
\[ M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

**Where:**
- \( P \) = Loan principal
- \( r \) = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- \( n \) = Total payments (years √ó 12)

### Example Calculation
For $10,000 loan at 5% APR over 5 years:
```python
P = 10000
annual_rate = 0.05
monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
n = 5 * 12

numerator = P * monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**n
denominator = (1 + monthly_rate)**n - 1
monthly_payment = numerator / denominator  # ‚âà $188.71
```

## Input Validation
| Parameter         | Valid Range       | Validation Error                  |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Annual Rate       | 0.01 ‚â§ rate ‚â§ 30  | "Invalid rate: Must be 0.01-30%"  |
| Loan Term         | 1 ‚â§ years ‚â§ 40    | "Invalid term: Must be 1-40 years"|
| Loan Amount       | 100 ‚â§ amount ‚â§ 10M| "Invalid amount: $100-$10M only"  |

## Output Samples
| Field              | Example Output                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Loan Date          | `2024-06-01T15:30:45Z` (ISO 8601) |
| Monthly Payment    | `$188.71`                       |
| Total Payment      | `$11,322.74`                    |
