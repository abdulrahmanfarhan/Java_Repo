# 💼 Bank System

**A Java-based console application for managing banking operations**

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Bank System** is a console-based application built in **Java** to simulate core banking operations. It enables users to manage customers, create and handle various account types, process transactions, and perform currency conversions. Designed as an educational project, it demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**, applied to a real-world banking scenario.

> **Supervised by**: Dr. Jalal Kiswani  
> **Institution**: Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan  
> **Purpose**: Educational demonstration of OOP concepts

## 📚 Class Structure

The project is organized into well-defined packages, each serving a specific purpose:

### `com.bank.core`
- **`Bank`**: Manages the bank entity and maintains a list of customers.
- **`Customer`**: Stores customer details (ID, name, email, phone) and their accounts.

### `com.bank.accounts`
- **`Account` (Abstract)**: Base class for all accounts, handling balance, transactions, and core operations (deposit, withdraw).
- **`CheckingAccount`**: Supports overdraft limits for flexible withdrawals.
- **`FixedDepositAccount`**: Manages fixed-term deposits with restricted withdrawals and interest calculations.
- **`IslamicAccount`**: Implements profit-sharing compliant with Islamic banking principles.
- **`Loan`**: Handles loan-specific features, including interest rates and payment terms.
- **`SavingAccount`**: Supports interest calculations and withdrawal limits.

### `com.bank.transactions`
- **`Transaction`**: Represents a single transaction (deposit or withdrawal) with type, amount, and timestamp.

### `com.bank.utilities`
- **`CurrencyConverter`**: Provides static methods for USD-to-JOD and JOD-to-USD conversions.
- **`InterestCalculator`**: Calculates simple interest or profit for applicable accounts.

### `com.bank.main`
- **`Bank_UI`**: Implements the console-based user interface for seamless interaction.
- **`main`**: Entry point of the application, initializing `Bank_UI`.
